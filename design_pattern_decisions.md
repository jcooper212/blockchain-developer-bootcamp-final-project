## Design Pattern #1
## Inter-Contract Execution (Calling functions in external contracts) Inter-Contract Execution, Part 1 and Part 2

This is exhibited in the following solidity function:

function createDaoWorkstream(string memory _workstreamName, address _workstreamOwner) restricted() external returns (address) {
    DaoWorkstream newWk = new DaoWorkstream(_workstreamName, owner, _workstreamOwner, payable(address(daoToken)));
    listDaoWorkstreams.push(address(newWk));
    listDaoWorkstreamNames.push(_workstreamName);
    emit NewWorkstream(_workstreamName);
    return address(newWk);
}


##Design Pattern #2
##Inheritance and Interfaces (Importing and extending contracts and/or using contract interfaces) Inheritances and Interfaces â€” (note: this is already a requirement in the final project, so you can simply describe which library or interface you use)

This is exhibited in the following solidity function:

contract DAOToken is ERC20 {
  address public admin;

  constructor() ERC20('DAO Token', 'DAOT'){
    admin = msg.sender;
  }
